<h3>Story and Concepts - A goblin’s job in a hero’s world</h3>
<p>In a typical fantasy RPG, you’re the chosen one, slaying monsters and looting treasure. But in *Goblin Cleanup*, you’re the poor goblin maid, left to clean up the mess.

There are no grand adventures or epic cutscenes—the story unfolds through the aftermath. Empty chests, overturned tables, cartoonish hunks of meat, and puddles of blood tell the tale of battles past.

<figure>
<img src="assets/images/goblin-cleanup-images/goblin-cleanup-early-access-careful-which-chest-you-pick.JPG" alt="Goblin Cleanup Early Access, two chests, surrounded by blood and meat, one chest has teeth the other shines with gold">
<figcaption>Be careful which chest you choose, one has a few more teeth than the other</figcaption>
</figure>

It’s a refreshing twist on the Fantasy Genre: you’re neither hero nor villain, but the essential worker keeping the dungeon running.</p>

<h3>Gameplay – Cleaning Dungeons, Dodging Traps, Surviving Monsters</h3>
<p>Goblin Cleanup’s premise sounds simple: mop up blood, fix furniture, and tidy treasure chests. But remember—you’re working inside a deadly wizard’s tower filled with traps, monsters, and magical chaos. Every clean-up run becomes a puzzle where survival is just as important as sweeping.</p>

<h4>Character Customisation – Building Your Perfect Goblin Maid</h4>

<p>At first character customisation is simple - a few hairstyles and colour schemes for your goblin maid. As you progress, you unlock new outfits, accessories and cosmetics via the in-game shop, giving your little green cleaner more personality.
</p>

<h3>Core Gameplay – Eat, Clean, Repeat</h3>
<p>Each shift is about restoring order. You’ll:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mop</strong> blood</li>
    <li><strong>Pick</strong> up meat chunks for tasty mimic snacks</li>
    <li><strong>Put</strong> treasure back into chests</li>
    <li><strong>Recharge</strong> magical traps and artifacts</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid</strong> dying to spikes, pits and angry monsters</li>

</ul>
 <p> It sounds mundane, but the constant threat of traps and monsters keeps it tense and rewarding.</p>
<h4>Tools of the Trade – Slimop, Managon, and More</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hands</strong> - Fix furniture, replace treasure, feed mimics (carefully)</li>
        <li><strong>Slimop</strong> - A pitchfork that lets you skewer slimes or carry “meaty kebabs”</li>
        <li><strong>Managon</strong> - A dragon-in-an-orb that drains or powers magical devices</li>
    </ul>

<p>Each tool has a practical function and a playful twist to change how you handle the mess</p>

<h4>Monsters & Minions – Friends, Foes, and Mimics</h4>
<p> This isn’t just maid work - the dungeon is alive with magical creatures that help (and often hinder) your progress.</p>

<h3>Progression – From Messy Rooms to Tower Mastery</h3>
<p>Each level has a checklist of objectives - from basic cleanup to optional challenges. Completing these earns tokens that unlock new dungeons, towers, and customisation items.
<figure>

<figcaption>The Tower knows all!</figcaption>
</figure>

Replayability comes from chasing 100% completion, experimenting with different cleaning strategies and laughing at the chaos that comes. </p>

<h3>Audio & Visuals – Grim Dungeons with a Comedic Twist</h3>
<p>Despite the grisly subject matter, the art style is wonderfully lighthearted. Instead of gore, you get stylised meat chunks and cartoonish blood pools. This strikes a balance between grim dungeon vibes and dark humour.

The audio design is equally effective:</p>


<ul>
<li>Dungeon halls echo with eerie ambience</li>
<li>Mimics chomp with disgusting satisfaction</li>
<li>Slimes squelch as they mop up blood</li>
<li>Shadowcats meow before they teleport</li>
</ul>
<p>Each detail reinforces the feeling that you’re in a dangerous, magical workplace.</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
<h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Addictive and funny gameplay loop</li>
    <li>Charming art direction that gives the dungeon vibe without being too gory</li>
    <li>Excellent sound design and atmosphere</li>
    <li>Unique take on the fantasy RPG formula</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Objects can be frustratingly hard to find (especially smaller ones under water)</li>
    <li>Early Access bugs and occasional jank</li>
    <li>Replayability suffers with the levels not changing between plays</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
  <h3>Final Verdict – Should You Clock In as a Goblin Maid?</h3>
<p>Goblin Cleanup is messy, quirky, and surprisingly satisfying. While still in Early Access, it already delivers a strong core loop and plenty of personality. If you enjoy games like Viscera Cleanup Detail or House Flipper but want a darker fantasy twist, this belongs in your library.</p>

<p>Rating: ⭐ 8/10</p>

<p>Standouts: Graphics, Sound Design, Gameplay Loop</p>
